# Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers are essential for the functioning of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). They provide the tokens that users need to trade on DEXs, and in return they earn fees on all trades that take place.

However, there are also risks associated with being a liquidity provider. You could lose money if the price of the tokens in the pool goes down. This is called impermanent loss. You could also lose money if there is a hack on the smart contracts.

Despite the risks, there are also rewards to being a liquidity provider. You can earn fees on all trades that take place in the pool, and you can help to decentralize the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
