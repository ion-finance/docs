# Pool Creation

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: Due to stability concerns, currently, only administrators can create pools.

Creating a pool on ION Finance is akin to setting up a unique trading hub where specific tokens can be exchanged. Think of it as laying the foundation for a mini-marketplace where chosen tokens can interact. By establishing a pool, you pave the way for these tokens to be traded on ION Finance, expanding opportunities for traders and liquidity providers alike.&#x20;
