3. Set the fee for the pool. Also, you can set `A` value in advanced option.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `A` value is a parameter that controls the curvature of the exchange rate curve. A higher `A` value means that the curve will be steeper, while a lower `A` value means that the curve will be flatter. This curvature affects how much slippage occurs when users trade on the stable pool

Once you have created the pool, you will be able to add liquidity to it by depositing the tokens that you selected. You will earn fees for providing liquidity to the pool.
