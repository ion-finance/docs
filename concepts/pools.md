# Pools

ION Finance offers two primary pools: Stable pools and Volatile pools.

#### Stable Pools

Stable pools cater to the exchange of tokens with consistent price percentages. When liquidity providers supply assets to a stable pool, the poolâ€™s liquidity deepens. This efficient utilization benefits liquidity providers and allows traders to exchange tokens with minimal slippage.

In a stable pool, theoretically, N assets can be paired together. For now, ION supports a maximum of 3 token pairs in one stable pool. To create more pairs, you can combine LP tokens from one pool with other stablecoins.

**Example:** A pair of stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI, all pegged around 1$, are perfect for the stable pool.

#### Volatile Pools

Volatile pools cater to the exchange of two assets with different prices. A pair in a volatile pool consists of two different tokens.
